<h2>📖 Story Behind the Project</h2>

<p>
The hospitality industry thrives on understanding its guests — their needs, preferences, and habits.  
But what if every booking, every cancellation, and every room night could speak to us?  
That’s the question that inspired me to create the <b>Hotel Booking Data Analysis</b> project.
</p>

<p>
This project marked a turning point in my data analytics journey.  
Unlike my guided projects, this one was completely <b>unguided</b> — an opportunity to apply everything I had learned on my own.  
The goal wasn’t just to analyze data; it was to <b>uncover the story hidden behind the numbers</b>.
</p>

<h2>🌍 The Challenge</h2>

<p>
Hotels often struggle with inconsistent occupancy, sudden cancellations, and unpredictable booking trends.  
Management teams are constantly asking questions like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>When is the right time to adjust room pricing?</li>
  <li>Which booking channels bring the most customers?</li>
  <li>How can we reduce cancellations and improve retention?</li>
</ul>

<p>
To answer these questions, I gathered a real-world dataset of hotel bookings and decided to build a <b>Power BI dashboard</b> that transforms raw booking data into <b>clear business insights</b>.
</p>

<h2>🧭 My Journey Through the Data</h2>

<p>
I started by cleaning and transforming the dataset using <b>Power Query</b> — removing duplicates, handling null values, and reshaping the data for analysis.  
Each record told a small part of the story: when people booked, when they canceled, where they came from, and what type of stay they preferred.
</p>

<p>
Then came the exciting part — building the <b>interactive Power BI dashboard</b>.  
I wanted to make data come alive, allowing hotel managers to explore trends visually and interactively.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>📅 Discovered <b>peak booking months</b> that help in planning marketing campaigns.</li>
  <li>🚫 Identified <b>cancellation trends</b> to reduce revenue loss.</li>
  <li>💬 Analyzed <b>booking sources</b> — revealing which channels brought in the most loyal guests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>💡 What I Learned</h2>

<p>
This project taught me that <b>data is more than just numbers</b> — it’s a reflection of human behavior.  
Behind every cancellation was a customer’s change of plan.  
Behind every booking peak was a seasonal opportunity.  
And behind every dataset was a story waiting to be told.
</p>

<p>
Through this, I strengthened my skills in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)</li>
  <li>Data Modeling with DAX</li>
  <li>Dashboard Design & Visualization (Power BI)</li>
  <li>Storytelling with Data</li>
</ul>
