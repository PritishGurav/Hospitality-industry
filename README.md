Project Overview
I took on an exciting project to dive deep into hotel booking data, creating a dynamic dashboard to unveil crucial insights for hotel management. Provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard, my mission was clear: develop key metrics, design a user-friendly dashboard, and discover hidden insights that could drive business success.
